# AuthFlow Whitepaper

Current blockchain based authentication methods typically only allow a developer to confirm who a user is and has to utilize other Web2 authentication methods and services to do anything beyond smart contract interactions. As we move into a Web3 world there are still many user cases that require secure access to Web2 technologies and even things as simple as just role based access control to an apps functions.

AuthFlow aims to be an on-chain replacement for something like AWS IAM or Azure Active Directory. Utilziing the Flow Blockchain we can return control of user identification and authentication back to the app developer. Each app will create their own AuthSystem that can be managed by multiple AuthSystemAdmins.
